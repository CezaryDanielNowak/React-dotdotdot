Installation
----------------
```
npm install --save react-dotdotdot
```

Sample usage
----------------
```
import React from 'react'
import Dotdotdot from 'react-dotdotdot'

...

render() {
	return (
		<div>
			<Dotdotdot clamp={3}>
				<p>
					Long, long <br />
					content,<br />
					3 lines <br />
					will be shown.
				</p>
			</Dotdotdot>
		</div>
	)
}

```


Dotdotdot props:
----------------
**clamp** (Number | String | 'auto'). This controls where and when to clamp the text of an element. Submitting a number controls the number of lines that should be displayed. Second, you can submit a CSS value (in px or em) that controls the height of the element as a String. Finally, you can submit the word 'auto' as a string. Auto will try to fill up the available space with the content and then automatically clamp once content no longer fits. This last option should only be set if a static height is being set on the element elsewhere (such as through CSS) otherwise no clamping will be done.

**useNativeClamp**: [default: `true`] Use -webkit-line-clamp available in Webkit (Chrome, Safari) only.
*splitOnChars*: [default: `['.', '-', '–', '—', ' ']`] Split on sentences (periods), hypens, en-dashes, em-dashes, and words (spaces).

**animate**: [default: false] animated clamp

**truncationChar**: The character to insert at the end of the HTML element after truncation is performed. This defaults to an ellipsis (…).
  `useNativeClamp` overrides it to default.

**truncationHTML**: String of HTML to use instead of truncationChar

**tagName**: [default: `div`] (String). The type of HTML tag which will wrap the component's content.

Notes

Known issues:
-----------------
- react-dotdotdot does not work with text containers with nested markup.
